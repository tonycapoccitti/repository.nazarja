import xbmcplugin   # contains functions required for creating directory structure style add-ons (plugins)

    SECTION 4:

    of a global variable from inside a function the value will revert back to the

    SECTION 5:
    Add our custom functions in here, it's VERY important these go in this section
    as the code in section 6 relies on these functions. If that code tries to run
    before these functions are declared the add-on will fail.

    You'll notice each function in here has a decorator above it (an @route() line of code),
    this assigns a mode to the function so it can be called with Add_Dir and it also tells
    the code what paramaters to send through. For example you'll notice the Main_Menu() function
    we've assigned to the mode "main" - this means if we ever want to get Add_Dir to open that
    function we just use the mode "main". This particular function does not require any extra
    params to be sent through but if you look at the Testing() function you'll see we send through
    2 different paramaters (url and description), if you look at the Add_Dir function in Main_Menu()
    you'll see we've sent these through as a dictionary. Using that same format you can send through
    as many different params as you wish.
